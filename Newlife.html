               <p>I researched e-commerce sites for small and large businesses to see how they present their products and information, and gain inspiration. Here are some of my favorites and what I took away from them:</p>

               <p>Michael already had some content for the site and wanted me to organize it in the most efficient way possible. As Michael is personally making these leather goods, I thought it was important to have a page describing him and his process to show reasons why customers should make a purchase. I saw this idea used by Mollyjogger in my competitive analysis.</p>

I made multiple versions of some sections, like the Home and Product pages. I wanted Michael to have a few options to choose from to make sure he is involved in the creation of the site and approves of the design decisions I have made.</p>

               <h5 class="paragraph-title">Summary</h5>
               <p>Michael has a beautiful story behind the name of his business, and I wanted to honor that in my branding. While brainstorming a brand identity, I thought about qualities that could connect with my client’s idea of “a new life” and leather. In the end, I decided to capture feelings of freedom, nature, and the wild west.</p>

               <p>For the font, I decided to go with Roboto Slab - Bold for the headers. Slab serif fonts give the type a strong, confident vibe. I chose Roboto - Regular as a secondary, I wanted an easy-to-read font that paired well with Roboto Slab. It's a family reunion!</p>

               <p>I wanted to develop a palette around brown, the color of leather and dirt. Trying to capture the feeling of an old western, I kept the color scheme mostly black and white, using the brown and yellow sparingly to grab the user’s attention where I wanted it to go. I also made sure not to use many colors on the shop page, so customers wouldn’t be distracted while browsing. I wanted their focus to be on the products only.</p>

            <div class="section-paragraph text-box">
               <h5 class="paragraph-title">Simple Setup</h5>
               <p>I am certainly not a high-end photography studio, and Michael wouldn’t be able to afford me if I was. I was inspired by the quality of images I saw on Mahabis’ site from my competitive analysis. In order to create my own high-quality, transparent images, I had to get creative. I put a wallet on a sheet of printer paper, set up my lighting stands, and took pictures with a high ISO (to ensure a white background). You can see my setup below.</p>
               <br>
               <p>Camera + Settings: Nikon D3400 with Sigma 18-35mm F1.8 DC lens, 1/80, f/10, ISO 1600.</p>
               <div class="light-bg"><img src="images/Newlife/NL-Setup.jpg" class="project-images" alt="My basic lighting and backdrop setup"></div>
               <p>I thought about what customers might want to see before they buy a product. For example, when I was taking pictures of a wallet, I wanted one picture of the front (closed), one of the inside (open), and one showing the mouth of the wallet. Here are 3 pictures I took of the same wallet, showing customers everything they might want to see before buying.</p>
               <div class="dark-bg"><img src="images/Newlife/NL-OGwallets.png" class="project-images" alt="The 3 wallets original photos - looks bland"></div>
            </div>
            <div class="section-paragraph text-box">
               <h5 class="paragraph-title">Adobe Lightroom</h5>
               <p>I edited the pictures in Lightroom to fix any exposure issues on the product and bring out its color and texture. This was important to make sure customers will see an accurate image of what they might buy. Before moving on, I also showed these images to Michael for him to pick which ones should be on the site.</p>
               <div class="dark-bg"><img src="images/Newlife/NL-LRwallets.png" class="project-images" alt="The 3 wallets after Lightroom - colors & texture enhanced"></div>
            </div>
            <div class="section-paragraph text-box">
               <h5 class="paragraph-title">Adobe Photoshop</h5>
               <p>Then, I took those photos into Photoshop to remove the background and make any other final changes. I wanted a transparent background so the products would stand out on the page.</p>
               <div class="dark-bg"><img src="images/Newlife/NL-PSwallets.png" class="project-images" alt="The 3 wallets after Photoshop - transparent background"></div>

         <!-- FINAL CHANGES -->

               <h5 class="paragraph-title">Hi-Fi Mockups</h5>
               <div class="no-bg"><img src="images/Newlife/NL_display.png" class="project-images" alt="New Life Home page on Desktop and Mobile"></div>
               <p>In this stage, I added the colors, fonts, and pictures to the wireframes to show Michael a first look at what his finished site would look like. He was very happy with a lot of the design and branding, but told me there were a few things he wanted to change:</p>
            </div>
            <div class="section-paragraph text-box">
              <h5 class="paragraph-title">Change 1</h5>
              <p>He wanted me to slightly change the white color. He felt the color I had picked was too pink. No problem, I selected a few different off-white colors, incorporated them into my final design to show him, and we ended up using a very, very faint orange color for the white.</p>
              <div class="no-bg"><img src="images/Newlife/NL-ColorChange.png" class="project-images" alt="Image showing the change of color on the home page"></div>
            </div>
            <div class="section-paragraph text-box">
              <h5 class="paragraph-title">Change 2</h5>
              <p>On the product information page, instead of offering a range of leather materials and thread that the customer could choose from, Michael wanted to use that space to show customers a specific material based on the product. In my design, I added a service that the client wasn’t comfortable offering to his customers, so I changed it.</p>

               <p>In the end, I created a design that both Michael and I are happy with. I was even able to use my hobby, photography, to create an opportunity for my client to upgrade the look of his products!</p>
               <br>
               <p>I learned to create multiple options for my client to choose from, and to consult them before making a decision for the business. This was my first step into the e-commerce world, and I learned a lot about what can make a business successful on the web.</p>
