            <h3>Uline Design Challenge</h3>
            <h4 class="text-space">UX Design Case Study</h4>
            <p class= "text-space">Uline is a leading distributor of shipping, industrial and packaging materials to businesses throughout North America. I was tasked to review the Uline website and identify one feature, enhancement, or change that could benefit their users. In this case study, I will show you my solution, and the process behind my design decisions.</p>

               <p class="text-space">I came up with a feature that allows businesses to automatically reorder materials every few days, weeks, or months on a subscription basis. I built this feature to work along with Uline’s 'Shopping Lists', lists of merchandise that customers can create and customize. To avoid unexpected and unwanted charges, users have to activate this feature to get started.</p>
               <p class="text-space">I wanted users to have the power to customize their order. Because Uline serves small and large size businesses, customers’ needs can vary widely.</p>

              <p class="paragraph-title">User Interviews -</p>
              <p>Sitting down and talking with someone who uses our site would give me insight into user needs and pain points in the process. Some questions I would ask are: “Why do you use Uline over our competitors?” “What do you dislike when using our site?”</p>
              <p class="paragraph-title">User Feedback Surveys -</p>
              <p>This would help me understand what people are thinking right after completing an order, and being able to send it out to every customer could give us a lot of data to work with. A question I would ask in this survey is “How satisfied are you with our service?”</p>
              <p class="paragraph-title">Persona -</p>
              <p>With more data to work with, I’d be able to create a persona that represents the user needs, goals, frustrations, and motivations.</p>

            <br>
            <ol>
              <li><p>1. Users have trouble finding the ‘Add to Cart’ button.</p></li>
              <li><p>2. Customers have to log into the site to reorder every time.</p></li>
              <li><p>3. Support is hard to find for customers who don’t want to call.</p></li>
            </ol>
          </div>
          <div class="section-paragraph text-box">
            <h4 class="paragraph-title">Solutions</h4>
            <p>With a few problems outlined, I brainstormed some solutions we could implement to improve the customer experience.</p>
            <br>
            <ol>
              <li><p>1. Create more opportunities to include the ‘Add to Cart’ button.</p></li>
              <li><p>2. Create a feature for users to set up a recurring order every few weeks or months.</p></li>
              <li><p>3. ‘Chat with Live Agent’ already exists, we can make it more accessible.</p></li>

          <div class="section-paragraph text-box">
            <h4 class="paragraph-title">Choosing a solution</h4>
            <p>Out of the 3 solutions, I chose to create a <span>Subscription Ordering</span> feature for shopping lists.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Instead of logging onto the site every time they need to buy something, customers can use this feature to place an order automatically every few weeks or months. We don’t want to surprise users with extra charges or orders, so I decided to make this a feature they have to set up or activate in a list’s settings.</p>

             <p class="text-box">I also included ways to change the frequency of their subscription and their next order date. These additional features allow users to customize their orders to their business needs. This was important to include because Uline serves a wide variety of business sizes.</p>

             <p>Once this feature goes live, we’d be able to add a survey link to an email with subscription orders. We could ask questions like: “How easy was it to set up Subscription Ordering?” or “How likely are you to use Subscription Ordering in the future?”</p>
             <p class="paragraph-title">User Testing -</p>
             <p>I would set a few users up with my prototype and give them some tasks to complete. A few tasks I could give them are “Set up Subscription Ordering on an existing list” or “Change the next order date with Subscription Ordering”. I would then analyse their movements around the prototype and how long it takes them to complete a task.</p>
