               <p class="text-box">I revisited this project and added microinteractions to give my design more life. To do this, I used Figma's "Smart Animate" function. There are a few advantages to including microinteractions in an app. Some apps use them to save time for their users, while others use them to show their branding. I decided to use microinteractions to communicate information and engage users.</p>
               <img src="images/virtuoso/Virtuoso_MI.gif" class="project-images" alt="GIF of microinteractions in Virtuoso">
               <p class="text-box">A simple interaction like this is more engaging than navigating between static menu and input screens. When users hover over separate buttons, a display appears that describes what that button will do. This will help users understand how to use the site quickly. Finally, once the user selects an action, the plus button moves up and becomes the "x" of the input field. All of these microinteractions give the user a more engaging experience while navigating the app.</p>

               <p class="text-box">As a minimum viable product, this project meets the requirements to enter development. I feel confident that Virtuoso could open up possibilities for teachers and students who are currently participating in remote learning, for any reason. I’ve learned how important user testing is, as it gives me a way to view my project through fresh eyes.</p>
               <br>
               <p class="text-box">In future projects, I will use user testing earlier in the process, starting with wireframes. This project has taught me that the design process is not a linear journey, it includes circling back to different stages of research and testing throughout. I am happy with how this turned out and eager to start on my next project!</p>
