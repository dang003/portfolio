               <h5 class="paragraph-title">Survey</h5>
               <p>I noticed a few trends from my survey results. 87.5% of users said they used cloud storage for personal reasons, like storing family photos. Also, 75% mentioned that organization was a major frustration with their current services.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="section-paragraph">
               <h5 class="paragraph-title">Competitive Analysis</h5>
               <p>I created a SWOT of major cloud storage sites to better understand the market and come up with an idea where my project might fit in. Instead of building an all-in-one site like Google Drive, I learned that it would benefit us more if our site targets a niche.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="section-paragraph">
               <h5 class="paragraph-title">Personas</h5>
               <p>I created some personas to showcase the common issues users face with current cloud storage services. Throughout the design process, I referenced my personas to make sure my final project would solve those problems.</p>

               <h5 class="paragraph-title">User Stories</h5>
               <p>Next, I created some user stories, based on features that users said they used on cloud storage sites in my survey. To prioritize, I ranked the more common answers as high priority. I ended up with four high priority stories.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="section-paragraph">
               <h5 class="paragraph-title">User Flows</h5>
               <p>I created user flows for high priority stories. The user flows were laid out in a way that allows the user to take multiple directions to arrive at the end goal. Creating these gave me a lot of insight into how I could organize the site.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="section-paragraph">
               <h5 class="paragraph-title">Wireframes</h5>
               <p>Next, I did some testing with basic wireframes. I gave each user 3 basic tasks: sign in to an account, upload pictures, and tag a note. These 3 tasks all use different features of the navigation, so I was able to understand how effective the site worked as a whole. In this stage, I was able to identify the issues in my wireframes. I addressed these issues while building mockups for the site.</p>

            <div class="section-paragraph">
               <h5 class="paragraph-title">Logo</h5>
               <p>I tried different names for the site, and different logos for each name. After settling on the name “CARGO”, I brought my favorite sketches into Figma to see how each one would look when polished.</p>
               <div id="cargo-pic" title="CARGO logo"></div>
               <p>I chose the logo that uses a box shape (similar to a cargo container) as the “O”, because it looks simple, friendly, and strong. I chose the font Roboto Bold because it looks simple and clean, and fit the width of the mark, making it look more like an “O”.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="section-paragraph">
               <h5 class="paragraph-title">Moodboard</h5>

               <div id="moodboard" title="Image of moodboard"></div>
               <p>Pulling from the moodboard, I was able to create a color scheme for the logo and site. Each color represents something different about the brand. Red = Excitement, Blue = Trust, Orange = Friendly, and Yellow= Happy.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="section-paragraph">
               <h5 class="paragraph-title">Icons</h5>
               <p>I wanted the icons to look fun, while still being clear to the user what each one means. I created the note and tag icon, and downloaded the rest from flaticon.com.</p>
               <div id="icons" title="Image of Icons used"></div>
               <p>I added a touch of orange (the main brand color) to each icon, except search. I wanted the search icon to remain clear to all users.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="section-paragraph">
               <h5 class="paragraph-title">Style Guide</h5>
               <p>In the style guide, I included the final logo in color, black, and white versions. I also provided the color palette, icons, copy fonts and sizes, and instructions showing how it should all be used.</p>

               <h5 class="paragraph-title">Preference Testing</h5>
               <p>The most notable change from the preference tests was the notification banner on the user home page. I wasn’t sure how to design a notification bar for this site. So, I tested two ideas. The results were split, and I realized that neither one would fix user issues.</p>
               <div id="notif-banner" title="Image of final notification banner"></div>
               <p>I decided to go back to the drawing board and ended up creating a welcome banner for users with a notification bar below it. This new design looks clean and provides the user with helpful information.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="section-paragraph">
               <h5 class="paragraph-title">Usability Testing</h5>
               <p>I asked some questions about the user’s thoughts on the site, and gave them three tasks to complete. The tasks were: make an account, upload an image, and tag a note. Most of these tests went smoothly, and I was able to get valuable information about how well the brand conveys its message to users.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="section-paragraph">
               <h5 class="paragraph-title">Final Changes</h5>
               <p>I edited some of the UI elements to avoid distracting the user.  Some of my final changes were:</p>
               <ul class="fa-ul final-changes">
                  <li>
                     <span class="fa-li"><i class="fas fa-check fa-2x check"></i></span>

                  </li>
               </ul>
               <p>I’m happy with this end product, as it solves problems users commonly face and reflects the core ideas of the brand image.</p>

            <p>CARGO was built from research and refined by user testing. I’m thankful for all the ideas that didn’t work out, because they taught me valuable lessons. I experienced the full design process of a project, from research to finished product. I learned that, as a designer, I should never assume I know what the users want.</p>
            <div id="last-mockup" title="Image of Cargo on a computer"></div>
            <p>In the future, with a full scope of the project in mind, I will be able to create better research questions and tests to help me arrive at a polished final design that will address the user’s needs.</p>
