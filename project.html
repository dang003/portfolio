      <h1>CARGO</h1>
      <h6>Case Study</h6>
      <p>CARGO gives travelers a platform where they can store, organize, and access their files. Photos, plans, and notes can all be created or uploaded with this cloud storage site.</p>

      <h2>problem.</h2>
      <p>Many cloud storage site users are frustrated by the difficulty of organizing their files. Users feel the current organization options aren’t accessible enough.</p>
      <h2>solution.</h2>
      <p>User files are stored in trips. Users also have the ability to add tags to their files, which lets them customize their organization. Users will be able to access files by opening a trip or by directly searching by title or tag.</p>

      <h2>research.</h2>
      <h5>Survey</h5>
      <p>I examined the current market of cloud storage and identified issues users are having. I noticed a few trends from my survey results. 87.5% of users said they used cloud storage for personal reasons, like storing family photos. Also, 75% mentioned that organization was a major frustration with their current services.</p>
      <h5>Competitive Analysis</h5>
      <p>I created a SWOT of major cloud storage sites to better understand the market and come up with an idea where my project might fit in. Instead of building an all-in-one site like Google Drive, I learned that it would benefit us more if our site targets a niche. A plan started to form in my mind for what my project might look like.</p>
      <h5>Personas</h5>
      <p>I created a few personas that reflect trends I noticed in my survey results. I used these to remind myself of the common issues users face with current cloud storage services. Throughout the design process, I referenced my personas to make sure my final project would solve those problems.</p>

      <h2>information architecture.</h2>
      <h5>User Stories</h5>
      <p>Next, I made some user stories. I included features that users said they used on cloud storage sites, like creating and sharing content. To prioritize, I ranked the more common answers as high priority. I ended up with four high priority stories. With these four stories, I avoided scope creep and was able to build a minimum viable product for this website.</p>
      <h5>User Flows</h5>
      <p>I created user flows for high priority stories. The user flows were laid out in a way that allows the user to take multiple directions to arrive at the end goal. Creating these gave me a lot of insight into how I could organize the site.</p>
      <h5>Wireframes</h5>
      <p>Next, I created some wireframes and did some testing. I had some ideas to help users organize their files, and I wanted to make sure these ideas were clear to the user and easily completed. I gave each user 3 tasks: sign in, upload pictures, and tag a note. These 3 tasks all use different features of the navigation, so I was able to understand how effective the site is as a whole. In this stage, I was able to identify a few issues in my wireframes. First, some UI elements (like buttons or notifications) were too large, and distracting the user. Also, the navigation to access certain files wasn’t clear. I addressed these issues while building mockups for the site.</p>

      <h2>branding.</h2>
      <h5>Logo</h5>
      <p>I tried different names for the site, and different logos for each name. After settling on the name “CARGO”, I brought my favorite sketches into Figma to see how each one would look when polished. I chose the logo that uses a box shape (similar to a cargo container) as the “O”, because it looks simple, friendly, and strong. I chose the font Roboto Bold because it looks simple and clean, and fit the width of the mark, making it look more like an “O”.</p>
      <h5>Moodboard</h5>
      <p>Next, I created a moodboard to show my image of the brand going forward. I made sure to include colors, copy, icons, and pictures that capture a certain emotion. I wanted this moodboard to communicate excitement, adventure, and simplicity. Pulling from the moodboard, I was able to create a color scheme for the logo and site. Each color represents something different about the brand. Red = Excitement, Blue = Trust, Orange = Friendly, and Yellow= Happy.</p>
      <h5>Icons</h5>
      <p>With the logo and colors set, I looked for icons that could fit into the existing brand image. I wanted them to look fun, while still being clear to the user what each one means. I created the note and tag icon, and downloaded the rest from flaticon.com. I added a touch of orange (the main brand color) to each icon, except search. I wanted the search icon to remain clear to all users.</p>
      <h5>Style Guide</h5>
      <p>I made a style guide to communicate my idea for the application of the brand to the client. I included the final logo in color, black, and white versions. I also provided a color palette, icons, copy fonts and sizes, and instructions showing how it should all be used.</p>

      <h2>testing.</h2>
      <h5>Preference Testing</h5>
      <p>I held some preference tests more usability tests on this “final” design. The most notable change from the preference tests was the notification banner on the user home page. Originally, I wanted to have a card at the top for users to access their notifications, but I wasn’t sure how to design it. I went with two ideas: Post-it note type cards, and a long banner. The results were split, and I realized that users didn’t like either one very much. A lot of users labeled the post-its as overwhelming, which I now agree with. I decided to go back to the drawing board and ended up creating a welcome banner for users with a notification bar below it. This new design looks clean and will hopefully not overwhelm anyone.</p>
      <h5>Usability Testing</h5>
      <p>I asked some questions about the user’s thoughts on the site, and gave them three tasks to complete. These tasks were based on my user stories. The tasks were: Make an account, Upload an image, and Tag a note. Most of these tests went smoothly, and I was able to get valuable information about how well the brand conveys its message to users.</p>
      <h5>Final Changes</h5>
      <p>I edited some of the UI elements to avoid distracting the user. I changed the left navigation to be smaller, and the upcoming trip notification to look cleaner. I learned to use icons on the cards so users can quickly identify what they’re looking for. Having multiple search bars on a page was confusing, so I replaced the search bar in the navigation to an icon. This icon, when clicked, brings up a search overlay which simplifies the search process. I also remade the trip navigation, choosing to keep all the navigation to the left side of the screen. This allowed me to save space and improve the user experience. I’m happy with this end product, as it solves problems users commonly face and reflects the core ideas of the brand image.</p>

      <h2>conclusion.</h2>
      <p>CARGO was built from research and refined by user testing. I’m thankful for all the ideas that didn’t work out, because I learned valuable lessons from them. I experienced the full design process of a project, from research to finished product. I learned that, as a designer, I should never assume I know what the users want.</p>
      <p>In the future, with a full scope of the project in mind, I will be able to make better research questions and tests to help me arrive at a polished final design that will address the user’s needs.</p>
