               <h4 class="paragraph-title">Competitive Analysis</h4>
               <p>I researched a few popular D&D apps for character creation and information tracking. This helped me see how a digital character sheet might look. Here is what I found.</p>
               <ul class="cs-list-text">
                 <li>
                   <div class="cs-list-title">

                     <h4>Information Overload -</h4>
                   </div>
                   <p>Most screens were packed with information, I didn’t know where to look. I need to design a simple layout that users could understand right away.</p>
                 </li>
                 <li>
                   <div class="cs-list-title">

                   <h4>No Noobs Allowed -</h4>
                 </div>
                   <p>The apps' onboarding process expects you to have a prior knowledge of D&D. This shows these apps are targeting experienced players. New players don't have digital resources to get started.</p>
                 </li>
               </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="section-paragraph text-box">
               <h4 class="paragraph-title">Card Sort</h4>
               <p>To make my app usable in-game, I had to digitalize the standard 5e character sheet. To do this, I needed to understand how players separate different sections of the character sheet. I planned to use this information to design the nav bar, so users can jump around the app to the information they need.</p>

                 </div>
                   <p>Once they have their character, players will have to update their information in-game. This could be adding new items, learning a new spell, or improving their stats.</p>

                 </div>
                   <p>D&D fans are creative. I wanted my design to allow customization to spells, items, classes, or anything else. This was less of a priority, as new players will mostly stick to the rules as written.</p>

                    </div>
                    <p>I gave more space to text in general, giving each item its own box. I added a slight space between boxes to signify separate elements. This will help users understand information on the screen.</p>

                    <p>For proficient abilities, I highlighted the whole box with red. This is a step away from the classic character sheet. This change makes it easier for new players to understand their proficiencies.</p>

              <p>This is where I stopped with this project. D&D is a big hobby of mine, and it was a lot of fun trying to improve the player experience. If I was taking this project all the way, here’s what I would do next.</p>
              <ul class="cs-list-text">
                <li>
                  <div class="cs-list-title">
                    <span class="list-icon"><i class="fas fa-circle"></i></span>
                    <h4>Usability Testing -</h4>
                  </div>
                  <p>I would give users a few tasks with my prototype to see if there are any issues that come up. My project targets new players, so I would look for people with little experience playing D&D.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <div class="cs-list-title">
                  <span class="list-icon"><i class="fas fa-circle"></i></span>
                  <h4>Success Metrics -</h4>
                </div>
                  <p>I would break down my design goals into measurable ones and question users after they are done testing the prototype. To measure the character creation process, I might ask, “How would you rate your understanding of the D&D character you created?”</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <div class="cs-list-title">
                  <span class="list-icon"><i class="fas fa-circle"></i></span>
                  <h4>Make Adjustments -</h4>
                </div>
                  <p>From testing and interviews, I would be able to analyze a lot of user feedback. Finding any problems and addressing them would elevate my design to the next level!</p>
                </li>

            <div class="section-paragraph text-box" id="conclusion">
               <p>Design is all about problem-solving. Whenever I encounter a problem in something I do, I want to fix it. This was my attempt of creating a solution for one of my hobbies. It shouldn’t be so hard to get started in D&D, and I have a lot of ideas about lowering the barrier to entry. This app would allow a large group of new players to play D&D, which would mean a lot more content for fans! If you're interested in optimizing the D&D player experience, please reach out - I'd love to talk.</p>
