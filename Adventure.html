               <p>I researched a few popular D&D apps for character creation and information tracking. This helped me see how a digital character sheet might look. Here is what I found.</p>
               <ul class="cs-list-text">

                   </div>
                   <p>Most screens were packed with information, I didn’t know where to look. I need to design a simple layout that users could understand right away.</p>

                 <li>

                   <p>The apps' onboarding process expects you to have a prior knowledge of D&D. This shows these apps are targeting experienced players. New players don't have digital resources to get started.</p>

               <p>To make my app usable in-game, I had to digitalize the standard 5e character sheet. To do this, I needed to understand how players separate different sections of the character sheet. I planned to use this information to design the nav bar, so users can jump around the app to the information they need.</p>

               <h4 class="paragraph-title">Summary</h4>
               <p>Michael has a beautiful story behind the name of his business, and I wanted to honor that in my branding. While brainstorming a brand identity, I thought about qualities that could connect with the products and my client’s idea of a "new life.” In the end, I tried to capture feelings of freedom, leather, and nature.</p>

               <p>For the font, I decided to go with Roboto Slab - Bold for the headers. Slab serif fonts give the type a strong, confident vibe. I chose Roboto - Regular as a secondary, I wanted an easy-to-read font that paired well with Roboto Slab. It's a family reunion!</p>

               <p>I created a color palette around the dirt brown color above, which represent nature and leather. I used the accents sparingly to grab the user’s attention where I wanted it to go. This was to help direct visitors towards the shop page and encourage them to make a purchase. I avoiding using colors on the shop page, so customers wouldn’t be distracted while browsing. I wanted the products to stand out on their own.</p>

               <h4 class="paragraph-title">Simple Setup</h4>
               <p>I was inspired by the quality of images I saw on Mahabis’ site from my competitive analysis. For an online store, high-quality images are essential to convince visitors to make a purchase. In order to create our own high-quality images, I had to get creative. I put a wallet on a sheet of printer paper, set up my lighting stands, and started shooting. You can see my setup below.</p>
               <br>
               <p>Camera + Settings: Nikon D3400 with Sigma 18-35mm F1.8 DC lens, 1/80, f/10, ISO 1600.</p>
               <div class="light-bg"><img src="images/Newlife/NL-Setup.jpg" class="project-images" alt="My basic lighting and backdrop setup"></div>
               <p>While shooting, I thought about what customers might want to see before they buy a product. For example, I wanted one picture of the front (closed), one of the inside (open), and one showing the mouth of the wallet. Here are 3 pre-edited pictures I took of the same wallet, showing customers everything they might want to see before buying.</p>
               <div class="dark-bg">
                 <img src="images/Newlife/NL-OGwallets.png" class="project-images" alt="The 3 wallets original photos - white background, but washed out colors">
                 <h5 class="cs-sub">A white background, but the wallets look washed out.</h5>
               </div>

            <div class="section-paragraph text-box">
               <h4 class="paragraph-title">Adobe Lightroom</h4>
               <p>I edited the pictures in Lightroom to fix any exposure issues on the product and bring out its color and texture. This was important to make sure customers will see an accurate image of what they might buy. Before moving on, I also showed these images to Michael for him to pick which ones should be on the site.</p>
               <div class="dark-bg PS-section">
                 <img src="images/Newlife/NL-LRwallets.png" class="project-images" alt="The 3 wallets after Lightroom - colors & texture enhanced">

            <div class="section-paragraph text-box">
               <h4 class="paragraph-title">Adobe Photoshop</h4>
               <p>Then, I took those photos into Photoshop to remove the background and make any other final changes. I wanted a transparent background so the products would stand out against the background of the page. This was a technique I saw done by Mahabis and TheHorse in my competitive analysis, and thought it looked really clean and professional.</p>

               <h4 class="paragraph-title">Hi-Fi Mockups</h4>
               <p>In this stage, I added the colors, fonts, and pictures to the wireframes to show Michael a first look at what his finished site would look like. He was very happy with a lot of the design and branding, but told me there were a few things he wanted to change:</p>
            </div>
            <div class="section-paragraph text-box">
              <h4 class="paragraph-title">Apples to Oranges</h4>
              <p>My client felt the color I had picked for the background was too pink, and not fitting with the brand. So, I revisited the branding and came up with some options. I incorporated these options into my final design to present to him, and we ended up using a very faint orange color for the background.</p>
              <div class="no-bg"><img src="images/Newlife/NL-ColorChange.png" class="project-images" alt="Image showing the change of color on the home page"></div>
            </div>
            <div class="section-paragraph text-box">
              <h4 class="paragraph-title">Ease Decision Paralysis</h4>
              <p>Once Michael told me how many thread and leather types he was offering for customers, I realized my design using images of each choice would be too overwhelming. I switched the design to a drop-down menu to save space and not give the user decision paralysis with too many options at once.</p>
