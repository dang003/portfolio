               <p class="text-space">Growing up in the greater Chicagoland area, I used to visit Brookfield Zoo often. Now, as a conversation designer, I saw an opportunity for a unique bot persona that can help families navigate around and encourage kids to learn more about animals. This chatbot is able to show off the zoo’s brand to families and gives them a new reason to be excited to visit.</p>

               <p>To better understand the company mission and brand, I completed research through their website at <a href="https://www.czs.org/Brookfield-ZOO/Home.aspx">https://www.czs.org/Brookfield-ZOO</a>. If I took this project into development, I would conduct interviews with stakeholders and team members to get a better understanding of the company’s needs and any information they have on their customers.</p>

               <h4 class="paragraph-title">Why Design a Chatbot?</h4>
               <p>In this stage, I had to figure out the scope and expectations for my project. I evaluated using chat or voice interfaces, open-ended conversations or more linear options, and what deliverables to expect for the MVP.</p>
               <br>
               <p>I decided on using a chatbot for a few reasons. For one, chatbots can be a great way to show your brand’s personality and connect with your users. Also, this experience is designed for use in a zoo, using a voice interface could pick up input from strangers (or monkeys) being a little too loud nearby.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="section-paragraph text-box">
               <h4 class="paragraph-title">Identifying Use Cases</h4>
               <p>I had to understand what people wanted to do during their trip to the zoo, frustration points, and what a chatbot could help them with. Should the bot be more service-oriented, or persuasive? I decided on creating 3 use cases that could show off the company’s personality and help their customers enjoy their visit.</p>

            <p class="text-box">For each use case, I went through the process of Design Canvas - Sample Dialogue - User Flows. The Design Canvas helps establish the context of the conversation, and leads to a more natural and realistic sample dialogue. Each sample dialogue was made referring to a specific goal, like “buying tickets to the dolphin show,” and allowing two humans to play the role of user and bot. From there, I created a high-level flow of the conversation and a more specific flow with questions and different answer paths. Check out my deliverables for each of use case below.</p>

              <p>This project is ongoing, as a way for me to practice what I've learned about conversation design. As I continue with this project, here it what I plan to do next:</p>
              <ul class="cs-list-text">
                <li>
                  <div class="cs-list-title">

                    <h4>Testing & Revision -</h4>
                  </div>
                  <p>I plan to take these happy paths for each use case and do some testing and revision. First, I'll conduct some WOZ testing to see how they hold up against a human. Second, I'd like to do an expert rewrite session with some peers. This will help me improve the effectiveness of these happy paths, for the 80% of users who would go through them.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <div class="cs-list-title">
                  <span class="list-icon"><i class="fas fa-circle"></i></span>
                  <h4>Detailed Design -</h4>
                </div>
                  <p>This is the next big part of the project I will tackle. Recognizing intents, designing for the long tail, and creating repair flows will help the 20% of users who deviate from the happy paths navigate the chatbot. No conversation design will work for everyone, so it's important to realize what we can do for the rest to resolve their issues.</p>
