               <p class="text-space">Growing up in the greater Chicagoland area, I used to visit Brookfield Zoo often. Now, as a conversation designer, I saw an opportunity for a unique bot persona that can help families navigate around and encourage kids to learn more about animals. This chatbot is able to show off the zoo’s brand to families and gives them a new reason to be excited to visit.</p>

               <h4 class="paragraph-title">Company Research</h4>
               <p>To better understand the company mission and brand, I completed research through their website at https://www.czs.org/Brookfield-ZOO/Home.aspx. If I took this project into development, I would conduct interviews with stakeholders and team members to get a better understanding of the company’s needs and any information they have on their customers.</p>

               <h4 class="paragraph-title">Why Design a Chatbot?</h4>
               <p>In this stage, I had to figure out the scope and expectations for my project. I evaluated using chat or voice interfaces, open-ended conversations or more linear options, and what deliverables to expect for the MVP.</p>
               <br>
               <p>I decided on using a chatbot for a few reasons. For one, chatbots can be a great way to show your brand’s personality and connect with your users. Also, this experience is designed for use in a zoo, using a voice interface could pick up input from strangers (or monkeys) being a little too loud nearby.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="section-paragraph text-box">
               <h4 class="paragraph-title">Identifying Use Cases</h4>
               <p>I had to understand what people wanted to do during their trip to the zoo, frustration points, and what a chatbot could help them with. Should the bot be more service-oriented, or persuasive? I decided on creating 3 use cases that could show off the company’s personality and help their customers enjoy their visit.</p>

                  <p>I would break down my design goals into measurable ones and question users after they are done testing the prototype. To measure the character creation process, I might ask, “How would you rate your understanding of the D&D character you created?”</p>

                  <p>From testing and interviews, I would be able to analyze a lot of user feedback. Finding any problems and addressing them would elevate my design to the next level!</p>

               <p>Design is all about problem-solving. Whenever I encounter a problem in something I do, I want to fix it. This was my attempt of creating a solution for one of my hobbies. It shouldn’t be so hard to get started in D&D, and I have a lot of ideas about lowering the barrier to entry. This app would allow a large group of new players to play D&D, which would mean a lot more content for fans! If you're interested in optimizing the D&D player experience, please reach out - I'd love to talk.</p>
